# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

def time(words)

# Shows how many minutes it will take it read
  time = words/200
# Rounds the minutes to 2 d.p.
  time.round(2)
 end
 
 Refactored:
 def time(wordss)
 time = words/200.round(2)
## 3. Create Examples as Tests

time(1000) ===> 5
time(1050) ===> 5.25

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
